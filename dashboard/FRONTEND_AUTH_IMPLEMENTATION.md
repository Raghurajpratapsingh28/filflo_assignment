# Frontend Authentication Implementation

## Overview
The frontend has been updated to support the two-tier authentication system with **Manager** and **Employee** roles. This implementation provides role-based access control and employee management functionality.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Updated Type System**
- Enhanced `User` interface with proper role typing (`'manager' | 'employee'`)
- Added `Employee`, `CreateEmployeeRequest`, and `UpdateEmployeeRequest` interfaces
- Updated all API interfaces to use proper role types

### 2. **Enhanced API Client**
- Added employee management endpoints:
  - `createEmployee()` - Create new employee (Manager only)
  - `getEmployees()` - Fetch all employees (Manager only)
  - `updateEmployee()` - Update employee details (Manager only)
  - `deleteEmployee()` - Delete employee (Manager only)
- Updated existing interfaces to use proper role types

### 3. **Updated Authentication Context**
- Added employee management functions to `AuthContext`
- Role-based access control in all employee management functions
- Proper error handling and user feedback

### 4. **Employee Management Components**

#### `EmployeeForm.tsx`
- Modal form for creating and editing employees
- Form validation and error handling
- Password field handling (optional for updates)

#### `EmployeeTable.tsx`
- Table view of all employees
- Create, edit, and delete functionality
- Loading states and error handling
- Responsive design

### 5. **New Pages**

#### `EmployeeManagementPage.tsx`
- Complete employee management interface
- Accessible only to managers
- Clean, professional UI

### 6. **Role-Based Navigation**
- Updated sidebar to show "Employee Management" only for managers
- Dynamic navigation based on user role
- Proper access control

### 7. **Route Protection**
- `RoleProtectedRoute` component for role-based access control
- Employee management page protected for managers only
- Proper access denied handling

### 8. **Enhanced Login Page**
- Shows default manager credentials
- Better user experience with role information

## Usage Examples

### 1. **Manager Login**
```typescript
// Default manager credentials
const managerCredentials = {
  username: 'manager',
  password: 'manager123'
};
```

### 2. **Creating an Employee**
```typescript
const { createEmployee } = useAuth();

const newEmployee = await createEmployee({
  username: 'employee1',
  password: 'password123',
  email: 'employee1@company.com'
});
```

### 3. **Fetching Employees**
```typescript
const { getEmployees } = useAuth();

const employees = await getEmployees();
```

### 4. **Updating an Employee**
```typescript
const { updateEmployee } = useAuth();

const updatedEmployee = await updateEmployee(employeeId, {
  username: 'new_username',
  email: 'new@email.com'
});
```

### 5. **Deleting an Employee**
```typescript
const { deleteEmployee } = useAuth();

await deleteEmployee(employeeId);
```

## Role-Based Access Control

### Manager Permissions
- ✅ Create, read, update, delete employees
- ✅ Access all inventory features
- ✅ Upload CSV files
- ✅ Generate receipts
- ✅ View dashboard KPIs
- ✅ Manage own profile
- ✅ Access Employee Management page

### Employee Permissions
- ❌ Cannot manage other users
- ✅ Access inventory features
- ✅ View inventory data
- ✅ Generate receipts
- ✅ View dashboard KPIs
- ✅ Manage own profile
- ❌ Cannot access Employee Management page

## Security Features

1. **Role Validation**: All employee management functions check for manager role
2. **Route Protection**: Employee management page is protected for managers only
3. **API Security**: Backend validates roles for all employee management endpoints
4. **Error Handling**: Proper error messages for unauthorized access
5. **Token Management**: JWT tokens include role information

## UI/UX Features

1. **Responsive Design**: Works on all screen sizes
2. **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators for all async operations
3. **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages
4. **Confirmation Dialogs**: Delete confirmations for safety
5. **Form Validation**: Client-side validation with proper feedback
6. **Role Indicators**: User role displayed in header
7. **Dynamic Navigation**: Menu items based on user role

## Testing the Implementation

1. **Start the backend** with the new authentication system
2. **Login as manager** using `manager` / `manager123`
3. **Navigate to Employee Management** (should be visible in sidebar)
4. **Create employees** using the form
5. **Edit/Delete employees** using the table actions
6. **Login as employee** (created by manager)
7. **Verify employee cannot access** Employee Management page

## API Integration

The frontend seamlessly integrates with the backend APIs:

- **Authentication**: `/api/login`, `/api/register`
- **Employee Management**: `/api/employees` (CRUD operations)
- **Profile Management**: `/api/profile`, `/api/change-password`
- **Inventory**: All existing inventory APIs

All API calls include proper authentication headers and error handling.

## Error Handling

The implementation includes comprehensive error handling:

- **Network Errors**: Proper error messages for API failures
- **Validation Errors**: Form validation with user feedback
- **Authorization Errors**: Clear messages for insufficient permissions
- **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators during operations

This implementation provides a complete, secure, and user-friendly employee management system integrated with the existing inventory management dashboard.
